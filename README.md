## Hi, I'm Sam McGuire 👋
### Under Development
I am currently working as an Economist providing technical support to the Central Bank of Somaliland as an ODI Fellow. Previously I worked in various Economist roles in the UK Civil Service. 
I am passionate about developing my technical skills and applying them to research problems or to improve efficiencies. 

🌍 Areas of Interest  
- Monitoring & Evaluation (Especially integrating innovative technologies into this)
- Financial Inclusion
- Better Data & Better Decision Making
  

🧰 Current Projects
- An Enumerator Quality Control Web App:
  Saving time and automating part of the QC process, under development and any input is very welcome. 
- Night-Time Lights as a proxy for Economic Development in Somaliland:
  Research paper to help understand the geographic disparities of economic activity in Somaliland as GDP statistics are unsuitable. 


⚙️ Personal Development  
Always keen to develop my skills, particularly around geospatial analysis and ML uses for data analysis. 😊
Excited to try and play around with  vegetation indexes and integrate it into future analysis.
I should probably continue to develop my web based skills too. 😅


### Papers & Writing:
Coming soon.

### Repositories:
